# Tests Directory

This directory contains test resources and test case definitions for the library management system.

## Contents

- Example artifacts you can add:
  - **test_cases.xlsx** (optional) – Comprehensive test case definitions including scenarios, inputs/expected outputs, edge cases, and validation criteria
  - CSV fixtures (e.g., sample_members.csv, sample_items.csv) for automated tests
